# Web Application for Public WiFi Monitoring

## Overview

This project develops a web application designed to enhance the accessibility and reliability of public WiFi information. In an era where Internet access is crucial, the availability of free WiFi services is expanding rapidly. However, typical challenges associated with accessing these free services include the inconvenience of usernames and passwords and the lack of reliable information about service quality and availability. Our application addresses these issues by implementing monitoring and cloud computing technologies to ensure that users receive accurate and verified WiFi information. The application is built using PHP to ensure responsiveness and adaptability across devices.

## Features

- **Real-Time WiFi Information**: Users can access up-to-date information about available public WiFi services integrated directly via Google Maps.
- **User Monitoring**: Incorporates technology to monitor and verify information shared by users about public WiFi spots.
- **Cloud Integration**: Utilizes cloud technology to store and manage data, enhancing the applicationâ€™s scalability and performance.
- **User Authentication**: Simplifies user access by providing a streamlined authentication process.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: Used for server-side scripting to ensure the application is responsive and accessible.
- **Google Maps API**: Integrates real-time geographic data to display public WiFi spots on a map.
- **Cloud Services**: Utilizes cloud computing technologies for data storage and management.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Provides the front-end framework, ensuring a user-friendly interface that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
